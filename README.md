Azure Blob Storage Project with Azure CLI

üìå Overview

The Azure Blob Storage Project demonstrates how to use Azure CLI in Cloud Shell to perform real-world cloud storage operations. Blob storage is a service for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary files.

In this project, I worked with the following key steps:

 - **Creating a Storage Account ‚Äì A storage account is the foundational resource in Azure that provides a unique namespace to store data.

- **Creating a Container ‚Äì A container acts like a folder inside the storage account, helping organize and group blobs.

- **Uploading Files ‚Äì Files (blobs) such as text documents and PDFs were uploaded to the container to simulate real use cases.

- **Verifying and Downloading Files ‚Äì Uploaded files were verified and downloaded to ensure data integrity.

- **Adding Metadata ‚Äì Metadata was attached to blobs in the form of key‚Äìvalue pairs to provide extra information, such as ownership and project name.

- **Listing Blobs ‚Äì Finally, the container was queried to list blobs and confirm that metadata was successfully applied.

By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience with Azure storage services and learned how to manage cloud resources using the CLI. This is an essential foundation for more advanced cloud computing tasks.

üöÄ Step-by-Step Implementation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Storage Account

A storage account is the top-level resource in Azure that provides a unique namespace for storing data.


### 2Ô∏è‚É£. Container Created 

A container organizes blobs inside a storage account (like a folder in a file system).

### 3. Hello.txt File Upload Successful  
A blob is an individual file stored inside a container.
Here, a simple text file (hello.txt) is uploaded.

### 4. Hello.txt File Check After Upload  
To confirm the upload worked, the file is downloaded again and verified locally.

### 5. After Uploading PDF & Verification  
To further test blob uploads, a PDF file was uploaded and verified in the container.

### 6.  Add Metadata to the File  
Metadata provides extra information about a blob in key-value pairs.

### 7. Hello.txt Download and Verification (Part 1) 
Download the file back and confirm it matches the original.

**‚ö° Challenges faced and Fixes**

File not found error (No such file or directory: 'hello.txt')

Cause: Tried uploading a file that was not in the current directory.

Fix: Created the hello.txt file locally before running the command.

Metadata not showing after update

Cause: Needed to re-run az storage blob show --query "metadata".

Fix: Confirmed metadata was successfully stored.

‚úÖ **Conclusion**

In this project, I successfully:

Created a storage account and container in Azure

Uploaded and downloaded blobs

Added and verified metadata

Documented the process with screenshots and logs

Learned how to troubleshoot common issues

**This project gave me practical exposure to managing Azure Blob Storage, which is a foundational cloud skill.**
